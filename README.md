For testing my code:  
For problem 1 I usede the arrhythmia.data , change the path to your local path for arrhythmia.data and it will work  
For problem 2 I use the data after runned by the function in problem 1  
For problem 3 I use the data after runned by th function in problem 2c which is discard_missing  
For problem 4 I used the data from train.csv, change the path to your local path fo train.csv and it will work  
For problem 5, I used the data after runned by th function in problem 2c which is discard_missing  
For each question, just print(function name) and will print the output  
For example for problem 1:  
my code wrote "import_data('C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\cs506\\arrhythmia.data')" on line 25  
just add a print(), turn it to print(import_data('C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\cs506\\arrhythmia.data')) and it will print the result  
no need to change anything else  
For example for problem 2a:  
I wrote "impute_missing(X1[0])" on line 30  
just add a print(), change it to print(impute_missing(X1[0])) and it will print the result  
no need to change anything else
